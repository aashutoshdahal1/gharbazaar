# Admin Authentication Fix - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Setup (`database.sql`)

- Added automatic creation of admin user when setting up a new database
- Admin credentials:
  - Email: `admin@gharbazaar.com`
  - Password: `admin123` (hashed with bcrypt)
  - Role: `admin`

### 2. Backend Changes

#### `scripts/createAdmin.js`

- Created a script to manually create the admin user
- Includes password hashing with bcrypt
- Prevents duplicate admin creation

#### `routes/auth.js`

- Added `/admin-login` endpoint for admin authentication
- Added `/change-password` endpoint for password changes
- Proper JWT token generation and validation

#### `routes/admin.js`

- Updated admin middleware to properly verify JWT tokens
- Added role-based access control
- Ensures only users with 'admin' role can access admin endpoints

#### `scripts/setupDatabase.js`

- Updated to automatically create admin user during database setup
- Ensures admin exists every time database is initialized

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### `pages/admin.jsx`

- Removed hardcoded credential validation
- Now makes API calls to `/api/auth/admin-login` endpoint
- Stores JWT token and admin user data in localStorage
- Removed display of default credentials

#### `pages/adminDashboard.jsx`

- Already configured to use JWT tokens for admin API calls
- Password change functionality works with the backend endpoint

## How It Works

1. **Database Setup**: When creating a new database, the admin user is automatically created
2. **Admin Login**: Frontend sends credentials to `/api/auth/admin-login`
3. **Token Generation**: Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token
4. **Protected Routes**: Admin dashboard uses JWT token to access protected endpoints
5. **Role Verification**: Backend verifies both token validity and admin role

## Testing

The admin authentication has been tested and verified to work correctly:

- Admin login endpoint returns proper JWT token
- Protected admin routes work with the token
- Role-based access control is functioning

## Credentials

- **Email**: `admin@gharbazaar.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`

These credentials are automatically created when setting up a new database and can be changed through the admin dashboard password change feature.
